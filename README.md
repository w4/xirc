# XIRC
Easy to configure XMPPâ†’IRC bridge. Simply configure config.yml to your liking and execute "python bot.py"

## Known Issues
- Having a user in IRC "jordan" and user in XMPP "jordan_" causes a third user "jordan__" to appear in XMPP, duplicating all of "jordan_'s" messages.
- Random errors all over the place
- Can currently only join one hard coded channel.
